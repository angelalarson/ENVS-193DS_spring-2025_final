# Problem 1 - Research writing

## a. Transparent statistical methods

In part one, they used a pearson correlation test. In part two, they used a one-way ANOVA.

## b. More information needed

Since the ANOVA returned at least two or more of the variables are statistically different from each other, we need to run a Tukey's post-hoc test to determine which specific nitrogen-containing variables are statistically different from each other. The ANOVA told us a statistically significant difference exists within the variables (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands), the post-hoc identifies between which variables.

Furthermore, we would run an eta squared test (n^2^) to determine the effect size. The effect size determines how much the grouping variable (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands) explains the response variable (average nitrogen load), given by the size of the variation in the response variable as described by the grouping variable. To put it simply, it describes how big of a difference exists between the variables, not just the significance. 

## c. Suggestions for re-writing

We determined there was a correlation between distance from headwater (km) and annual total nitrogen load (kg year{-1}) (Pearson correlation test, r = **correlation coefficient**, p = 0.03, $\alpha$ = **significance level**). 
We found a small/medium/large ($\eta^2$ = **n^2^**) difference between sources (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands) in average nitrogen load (kg year{-1}), (one-way ANOVA, F(**among groups df, within groups df**) = **F-statistic**, p = 0.02, $\alpha$ = **significance level**). On average, **source** tended to have smaller/larger nitrogen loads than **source** (Tukey's HSD: p < **p-value**).

# Problem 2 - Data visualization

        aes(x = month, # assigning x axis to be month

```
# Problem 3 - Data analysis
```{r cleaning data}
nest_boxes_clean <- nest_boxes %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(season = factor(season))
```
## a. Response variable

The response variable is Swift Parrot box occupancy (binary variable "sp"), where 1 indicates a box occupied by a Swift Parrot. 0 would represent occupancy by the Common Starling or Tree Martin, or not occupied at all. 

## b. Purpose of study

The Swift Parrot, a critically endangered species and the focus of restoration efforts, is the target species of this restoration-based study that aims to determine whether nest boxes promote nesting of the target species or of its competitors, the Common Starling and Tree Martins. If competitors nest in the boxes, it could potentially impact the Swift Parrot's nesting success and project goals. 

## c. Difference in “seasons”

This study compares two seasons: 2016, when the nest boxes were first installed, and 2019, three years later. This time gap allows the author to examine changes in nest box use over time, specifically whether or not competitor species occupy more boxes meant for the Swift Parrot over the three years. 

## d. Table of models

| Model number | Season |  Forest Edge Distance    | Model Description            | 
|:------------:|:------:|:------------------------:|------------------------------|  
| 0            |        |                          | no predictors (null model)   |
| 1            |    X   |             X            | both predictors              | 
| 2            |    X   |                          | season only                  |   
| 3            |        |             X            | forest edge distance    only |    

## e. Run the models

```{r fitting the model}
#| message: false
#| echo: false

results = 'hide'
# model 0: null model
model0 <- glm(
  sp ~ 1, # no predictors
  data = nest_boxes_clean, 
  family = "binomial" # include for binomial data
)

# model 1: all predictors
model1 <- glm(
  sp ~ season + edge_distance, # full model 
  data = nest_boxes_clean,
  family = "binomial" # include for binomial data
)

# model 2: season only
model2 <- glm(
  sp ~ season, # season only
  data = nest_boxes_clean,
  family = "binomial" # include for binomial data
)

# model 3: forest edge distance only
model3 <- glm(
  sp ~ edge_distance, # only edge distance
  data = nest_boxes_clean,
  family = "binomial" # include for binomial data
)
```

## f. Check the diagnostics

```{r running diagnostics}
#| message: false

# Model 0
plot(
  sim0 <- simulateResiduals(model0)
)
# Model 1
plot(
  sim1 <- simulateResiduals(model1) # redisuals look ok for best model
)
# Model 2
plot(
  sim2 <- simulateResiduals(model2)
)
# Model 3
plot(
  sim3 <- simulateResiduals(model3)
)

```

## g. Select the best model

```{r model selection}
AICc(model0,
     model1, # lowest AIC, best model
     model2,
     model3) %>% 

  arrange(AICc) # arranging output in descending order of AIC
```

The best model, based on Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), included season, forest edge distance, and their interaction as predictors of Swift Parrot nest box occupancy. The model including both season and forest edge distance had the lowest AIC value, indicating the best trade-off between model simplicity and fit among the models tested.

## h. Visualize the model predictions

```{r model predictions}
#| message: false

model1_predictions <- ggpredict( model1, # naming model object
  terms = c("edge_distance", "season") # listing predictors
) %>% 
  rename(
    edge_distance = x,
    season = group
  )

view(model1_predictions)
```


```{r visualizing model}

ggplot(data = nest_boxes_clean, # using nest_boxes_clean data frame
       aes(x = edge_distance, # x is edge-distance
           y = sp, # y axis
           color = season)) + # color grouped by season
  
  geom_point(size = 3, #change size

              alpha = 0.4, # adjusting transparency
              color = NA) + # remove border on ribbon

                y = predicted, # y is predicted occupancy probability
                color = season), # group color by season
            size = 1.2) + # change line thickness
  
 scale_color_manual(values = c("2016" = "violetred", "2019" = "gold2")) + # changing colors to associate with season
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("2016" = "violetred", "2019" = "gold2")) +

  labs(
    x = "Distance to forest edge (m)", #  axis label
    y = "Probability of Swift Parrot occupancy", # y axis label
    color = "Season", # legend title for line color
    fill = "Season", # legend title for ribbon color 
    title = "Swift Parrot nest box occupancy as determined by distance to forest edge and year" # title label
  ) +
  theme_cowplot() + # use cowplot theme to remove lines and such
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8), # place legend inside x axis
         plot.title = element_text(size = 11)  # change title font size
) 
  
```

## i. Write a caption for your figure.


## j. Calculate model predictions

```{r model1 predictions, 0 to 900 m}
#| message: false

model1_0_900 <- ggpredict( # using ggpredict for model predictions
  model1, # using best fit, model1
  terms = c("edge_distance [0,900]", "season") # runs model with parameters and specifically edge_distance 0-900 m
)

model1_0_900 # View the output
```

## k. Interpret your results


# Problem 4 - Affective and exploratory visualizations

## a. Comparing visualizations

I decided to represent the data in Homework 2 as a line graph and box plots, and didn't really get any clear visuals of the data at the time. By grouping the data into four different time slots and representing them as bar graphs, I was able to see visual patterns appear between step count and time on campus.

There aren't many similarities, however I similarly saw that grouping steps by exercise type really showed no correlation between average step count and exercise type. 

The most clear pattern is in the affective visualization as the average number of steps is somewhat correlated to time on campus; however, all the standard error bars overlap with each other so that correlation is only observed and would not be supported statistically. I plotted number of steps against time on campus as a line graph in homework 2, which showed a similar correlation as to what was observed in the final visualization. However, with so few points in homework 2, it is hard to compare as the data was quite variable at the time.

I received primarily positive feedback, however it was suggested that I incorporate color into my drawing to visually distinguish between mean and error bars and buildings. I incorporated color to make it as visually distinguishable as possible.

## b. Sharing your affective visualization

This was done during section at Friday, 9am section.
